A Basic Search App I created to learn how to use React Hooks and CSS Grid.

1)  You will need to attain an apiKey from https://rapidapi.com/contextualwebsearch/api/web-search
2)  Setup a ```secret.js``` file with values imported in ```fetchData.js```
3)  Run ```npm start```
4)  Enjoy!


LoadingIndicator is not mine. I just modified the code from: https://loading.io/css/
